My bachelor degree project with microcontrollers and android studio.
      
      The Python scripts stands as a wifi module (I'm not proud of this), connects to Firebase database and read the informations from arduino and then writes this informations on the database.
      
      In the arduino code we set up the sensor pins, read the information and then print it.
